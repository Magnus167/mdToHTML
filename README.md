# md.htm

## Usage:

`www.yourwebsite.com/md.htm?src=<link_to_md>`

Note: if MD file is in the same directory as md.htm, simple the filename will suffice. 

`magnus167.github.io/mdToHTML/md.htm?src=<link_to_md>`

this would look like



### Example:

`magnus167.github.io/mdToHTML/md.htm?src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Magnus167/mdToHTML/main/README.md`

or 

`magnus167.github.io/mdToHTML/md.htm?src=README.md`

since README.md is hosted in the same directory as md.htm


## Note:

if the MD file is hosted on github, the raw link where the file is hosted must be used.

### Example:

if the file is hosted at 

`username/repo_name/branch_name/file.md` 

the URL to the raw file would be

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/repo_name/branch_name/file.md`

you can get the raw link by viewing the file on github, and clicking on "raw" right above the file preview.

Similarly, 
for this file at 
`/Magnus167/mdToHTML/README.md` (https://github.com/Magnus167/mdToHTML/README.md)

the raw link is 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Magnus167/mdToHTML/main/README.md
 
 the link will look llike
